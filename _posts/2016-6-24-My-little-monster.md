“Processing is an open source programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks.”

I have copied three more arms, drew body, legs and head.
It was little big hard, because I didn't know which command is doing, but through trials and errors I did it.
