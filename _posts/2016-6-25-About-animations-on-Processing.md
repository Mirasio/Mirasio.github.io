Hello people! Today I want tell you about my first animation on Processing.

On the leson we showed few animations, where it has been shown that the circles took the color of the pixel on which they stood. 
My turn was almost a good and [that's what happened](http://mirasio.github.io/smile).

Than Sherol showed we how to do this animation and [that's what I could do](http://mirasio.github.io/mario).

And I liked this than I wanted to do one more animation. It whas [this](http://mirasio.github.io/girl).

I understood, working on Processing language is awesome. I didn't see programming languages like this. On processing language you have a lots of opportunities. I like this.
