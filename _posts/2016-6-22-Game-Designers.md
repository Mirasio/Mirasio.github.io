Hello!!! My name is Miras. And I want to tell you about game creators. It's very interesting!


  To create the game you need minimum 5 people with different roles. There are:
  
  1)  Producer                                                                             
  2)  Designer                                                                             
  3)  Engineer                                                                             
  4)  Scientist                                                                             
  5)  Artist
